This is a shader showcase built with Unity5.3.5f1(64-bit).

None of the shader used in this showcase are built-in shader. They are all hand-written shader inspired by the Unity shader book I have been reading.

To prove the scene is real-time rendered, you can click your left and right button and see what could happen. Have fun!
